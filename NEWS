0.5.0:

* numerous fixed for random behaviour resulting in failed session restores
* bitrot removal, GCC4 fixes, autotools updates, etc
* added GTK control panel server interface client
* removed all traces of former name (API is incompatible with previous
  releases, search replace "CCA" and "LADCCA" with "LASH", and "cca_" with "lash_")

0.4.0:

* low level tcp protocol has changed along with a lot of structure clean ups
  on the client- and server-side.
* added low level protocol versioning
* well defined server interface protocol (that works! :)  this has been the bulk
  of the work that's added two more properties to lash_event_t, client_id and
  project, bumped the major version of the high level protocol and caused more
  changes to the low level protocol
* new high level normal client event, CCA_Server_Lost
* removed CCA_Use_Jack and CCA_Use_Alsa client flags; sending the server
  the jack client name or alsa client id now suffices
* major amounts of cleanups and fixes
* server now saves project info in XML which means a new dependency on libxml2
* socket stuff now uses protocol-agnostic system calls and the server defaults
  to IPv6.  an entry in /etc/services is required to support this.  make install
  will install an entry if there isn't one present.  this can be disabled with a
  configure option, --disable-serv-inst.  there's also a new option for lashd,
  --no-ipv6 which, suprisingly, stops the server using ipv6.
* the --with-default-dir configure option and -d lashd option now set the
  directory relative to $HOME, rather than being a system-wide directory
* project directories now get cleaned up if they haven't been saved
* updated the manual

Patches

* fluidsynth cvs


0.3.2:

* fixed a missing #include


0.3.1:

* fixed problem with the readline headers paying attention to HAVE_CONFIG_H
* fixed HAVE_GTK2 always being defined to work properly and only be defined
  if it's available


0.3.0:

* Added the facility to run restored apps in a terminal using xterm, and
  added the CCA_Terminal client flags for clients that need a terminal to
  operate.
* much improved jack and alsa listeners in the server
* quite a few compilation and bug fixes and whatnot


0.2:

* Added protocol versioning
* lashd now permanently listens to jack and alsa, with seperate threads
  dealing with each.  it backs up all the alsa and jack connections every 30
  seconds so that a client's connections can be resumed automatically, and
  it's also much better seperation of the jack/alsa/project code
* fixed loads of bugs
* fixed file permissions for config data files, making stores actually work
* well defined client event protocol, documented in the manual
* minor api changes and additions
* added a gui to the synth client, and made it try and get real-time-ness
  for the midi thread.  fixed the dodgey sound (for some reason, the jack
  buffer was being cast to doubles instead of floats.) it's actually usable now.

* jack rack 1.0
