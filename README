This is not a "project", but an entire repository of code containing many
projects (checked out from http://codeson.net).  The only common thread
tying it all together is that I wrote it.  Hi. :)

There are build scripts in this directory for convenience, but every
subdirectory can be used individually as an independent (autotoolized)
project.

'./configure --help=recursive' will give you a (horribly large and bloated)
listing of all configure options which you can pass to the top level
configure script to build everything however you like.

Enjoy,
