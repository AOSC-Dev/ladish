LASH Audio Session Handler

This is a daemon, a client library and a some clients that implement a session
management system for audio applications on GNU/Linux.

To get an idea of what it can do, I suggest doing this:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
$ lashd

then, in different consoles, run lash_panel and lash_synth.  Make
some Jack and Alsa Sequencer connections to the synth using aconnect and 
jack_connect (or your patch bay of choice).

Play around with the settings of lash_synth, and click "Save Project" in the
control panel (you'll have to select a directory to save to).  Then click
"Close Project" and all running LASH clients should exit, and the project
tab in lash_panel should disappear.

Now use the "File->Open Session" menu item to open your saved project.  The
synth (and any other runnings LASH clients) should restart, and all the Jack
and Alsa MIDI connections should be restored.  Phat.

The interesting header files are client_interface.h, types.h, config.h and
event.h, all in the lash/ directory.  There is a partially complete
texinfo manual in the docs/ directory.
