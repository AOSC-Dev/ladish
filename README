LASH Audio Session Handler

This is a daemon, a client library and a some clients that implement a session
management system for audio applications on GNU/Linux.

To get an idea of what it can do, I suggest doing this:

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
$ lashd

then, in different consoles, run lash_gtk_client and lash_synth.  Make
some jack and aseq connections to the synth using aconnect and jack_connect.
Add some configs and open a file in lash_gtk_client.  Then click on save
in lash_gtk_client.  Now close both the clients (just ^C the synth.)  Now
run lash_control and type "restore /home/<user>/audio-projects/project-1". 
The synth and gtk client should restart, and the synth's connections should
be restored.  Phat.

The interesting header files are client_interface.h, types.h, config.h and
event.h, all in the lash/ directory.  There is a partially complete
texinfo manual in the docs/ directory.
