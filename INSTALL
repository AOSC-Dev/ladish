= Configure it =

./waf configure

This will configure for installation to /usr/local prefix.
If you want to use other prefix, use --prefix option:

./waf configure --prefix=/usr

For full list of options, run:

./waf configure --help

= Build it =

./waf

You can use -j option to enable building on more than one CPU:

./waf -j 4

./waf install

You probably want to run later as superuser to install system-wide
