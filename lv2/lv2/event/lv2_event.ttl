A single generic time-stamped event.

An lv2ev:EventPort contains an LV2_Event_Buffer which contains a sequence
of these events.  The binary format of LV2 events is defined by the

Specific event types (e.g. MIDI, OSC) are defined by extensions, and should

Indicates that this port supports or \"understands\" a certain event type.
For input ports, this means the plugin understands events of this type,
for output ports, this means the plugin may generate events of this type.
Plugins with event input ports must always gracefully handle any type of event,
even if it does not 'support' it.  This property should always be set for
event types the plugin understands/generates so hosts can discover plugins
appropriate for a given scenario (e.g. plugins with a MIDI input).
Hosts are not expected to consider event ports suitable for some type of
event if the relevant :supportsEvent property is not set.
