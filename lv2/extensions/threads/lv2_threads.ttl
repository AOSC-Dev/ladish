## Thread Base Classes ##
#########################

:Thread a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Thread" ;
	rdfs:comment """
A thread (execution context) of a plugin.
""" .


:RollingThread a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf :Thread ;
	rdfs:comment """
A thread which is is continually executed in blocks (like the standard LV2
run callback).  The thread run callback has the signature:

void run(LV2Handle Instance, uint32_t SampleCount)

When run is called, SampleCount frames worth of input/output should be
read/written to all ports associated with this thread.
""" .


:BlockingThread a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf :Thread ;
	rdfs:comment """
A thread which is executed only when there is work to be done
(e.g. a message is received).  The thread run callback has the signature:

bool run(LV2Handle Instance)

When run is called, any pending input in ports associated with this thread
should be processed, and true returned iff output was written (meaning
plugins connected to those output ports should be executed as well).

Any plugin with a BlockingThread context must provide an additional function
with the signature:

bool has_data(LV2Handle Instance, uint32_t port)

which is guaranteed to be called only from the thread associated with port,
and must return true iff the port is an output and contains pending data
(resulting from the preceding call to this thread's run method).

The HostFeatures struct passed by the host to the plugin's instantiate method
contains a function with the signature:

void request_run(const char* context_uri)

which allows the plugin to specifically request execution of a blockin
thread's callback from a rolling thread (e.g. the main LV2 run method).  If
the plugin is hardRtCapable, this method must be realtime safe.

## Thread Hints ##

:ThreadHint a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label      "Thread hint" ;
    rdfs:subClassOf lv2:Hint ;

:hardRTCapable a :ThreadHint ;
    rdfs:label   "Hard realtime capable" ;
    rdfs:comment """
Indicates that the thread is capable of running in a "hard real-time"
environment, with identical conditions as lv2:hardRTCapable (see lv2.ttl).

## Thread Priorities ##
#######################

:ThreadPriority a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:label "Thread priority" ;
	rdfs:comment """
The scheduling priority of a thread.
""" .

:AudioPriority a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf :ThreadPriority ;

Signifies a thread should be run with priority equal to that of the
standard LV2 run callback.

	rdfs:comment """
Signifies a thread should be run with priority equal to that of the
main thread of the host (typically non-realtime default system priority).
""" .


:HighPriorityWorker a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf :Thread ;
	rdfs:comment """
A worker thread with a high priority, just below that of the main run
callback.  If the run callback is run with realtime priority, the host
should run this thread with (slighly lower) realtime priority as well.
""" .

:LowPriorityWorker a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf :Thread ;
	rdfs:comment """
A worker thread with a low non-realtime priority.
""" .


:MessageThread a rdfs:Class ;
	rdfs:subClassOf :BlockingThread ;
	rdfs:comment """
A blocking thread for on demand message-based processing.
