LV2
---

LV2 is a standard for plugins and matching host applications, primarily
targeted at audio processing and generation.

LV2 is a successor to LADSPA, created to address the limitations of LADSPA
which many applications have outgrown.  Compared to LADSPA, all plugin data
is moved from the code to a separate data file, and the code has been made as
generic as possible.  As a result, LV2 can be independently extended
(retaining compatibility wherever possible), and virtually any feasible
plugin features can be implemented in an LV2 plugin.

More information about LV2 can be found at <http://lv2plug.in>.
