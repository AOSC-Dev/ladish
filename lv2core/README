LV2
---

LV2 is a standard for plugins and matching host applications, primarily
targeted at audio processing and generation.

LV2 is a successor to LADSPA, created to address the limitations of LADSPA
which many hosts have outgrown. LV2 is not backwards compatible, but migration
tools will be released once the specification is finalized.

More information about LV2 can be found at <http://lv2plug.in>.
