The various components here can be built individually inside their own
directories, or the entire tree can be built at once, using the typical
./configure; make; make install routine.

If you build individuall, get the build order right!  Things will NOT
compile against the included versions this way.

You're much better off building everything from the top level.

So much better off that you had better not come bother me on IRC with
broken builds because you screwed it up, or I won't be very nice ;).

Switching back and forth between each method requires a new autogen.sh
in whatever dir you plan to build from.
