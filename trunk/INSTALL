The various components here can be built individually inside their own
directories, or the entire tree can be built at once.

This software uses waf, which is included.  Basically:

./waf configure --prefix=/foo/bar
./waf
./waf install

The default install prefix is /usr/local (just './waf configure' is OK).
The build step takes a -j parameter for parallel building, like make.
The install step obeys the DESTDIR environment variable.

See ./waf --help for more information.

If you build individually, get the build order right!  Things will NOT
compile against the included versions this way.

*** IMPORTANT ***

You MUST clean your build if you want to switch between building the
whole tree and configuring each project separately.  If you mix the
two processes without cleaning BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.
