This repository contains several projects.  Most are related, and many have
direct dependencies.  They all share a unified build system (based on waf)
that can be used to build the entire repository at once, or each project
separately.  See INSTALL file for details.

Information on the web about this software lives at <http://drobilla.net/>

*** IMPORTANT ***

You MUST clean your build if you want to switch between building the whole
repository and configuring each project separately.  If you mix the two
processes without cleaning BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN.
