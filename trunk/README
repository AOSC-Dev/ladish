This is not a "project", but an entire repository of code containing many
projects (checked out from http://drobilla.net).  Most things in here have
interdependencies, so it is much simpler to follow a single repository in
this style than have to keep n separate ones in sync.

There are build scripts in this directory for convenience, but every
subdirectory can be used individually as an independent (autotoolized)
project.

'./configure --help=recursive' will give you a (horribly large and bloated)
listing of all configure options which you can pass to the top level
configure script to build everything however you like.

NOTE: if you use the top-level configure/make, everything should be built
against the local copies in this tree, but if you compile the packages
yourself in their own directories, they will build against the libraries
installed on your system.

Most of this code is in active development.  Please reports any bugs or
requests at http://dev.drobilla.net/

Share and Enjoy,
